# Stoic

![stoic](./demo.png)

Stoic is a command-line application for daily journaling with plain-text files. It helps maintain day-to-day journaling habits by allowing you to:

- Instantly edit the current day's entry
- Journal using any plain-text format (txt, md, [xit](https://xit.jotaen.net/), or anything else)
- Use journal file template support
- Work on Linux and OSX
- Review and filter existing entries

## Installation

Installation is possible through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Linux or MacOS.

`brew install skatkov/tap/stoic`

You can also download the executable directly. See the ðŸ“¥ [Installation](INSTALL.md) instructions.

## Usage

In a terminal:

- `stoic`: open today's journal entry in the editor
- `stoic -list` (beta): list existing entries and pick one for editing
- `stoic -edit "<natural date>"`: open or create the previous day's file using natural dates like "2 days ago" and "yesterday"
- `stoic -quote`: shows a random quote encouraging the journaling habit
- `stoic -about`: shows information about the application

## Configuration

- The editor could be changed by setting the `$EDITOR` global variable. (default: `nano`)
- The directory for a journal could be changed by setting the `$STOIC_DIR` global variable. (default: `~/Journal/`)
- Provide file template through `$STOIC_TEMPLATE` global variable.
- Provide new extension format through `$STOIC_EXT` global variables. (default: `md`)

```shell
export EDITOR="neovim"
export STOIC_DIR="~/MEGAsync/journal/"
export STOIC_TEMPLATE="~/MEGAsync/journal/template.md"
export STOIC_EXT="md"
```

## Motivation

There is a recurring theme in biographies of great people. They had journaling as a hobby.

I've been battling my inner demons with different methods with varying success. But journaling has helped me keep these demons permanently at bay. My sleep will be peaceful if it follows after careful and honest self-examination in my journal.

Existing software for journaling and note-taking needs to be faster to load and filled with features I don't need. Plain-text files stored in cloud storage and edited through Nano are more than enough. However, some recurring manual work was still required: creating a new daily file and modifying it according to my template. This command line utility completely removes that manual work for me.

Epictetus, the great Stoic philosopher and slave, once told his students that "philosophy is something one should write down day by day". Hence, the name of this tool is a reference to this great human and a hat tip to the practical philosophy called Stoicism.

## Obsidian integration

I wrote this tool out of frustration with existing note-taking apps (everything has to be in the cloud these days), but other apps followed similar design choices as Stoic did.

I'm now using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a fully featured writing app. Obsidian comes with some core plugins that you can enable. One is "Daily Notes", which does something similar to Stoic. Nonetheless, I still keep using Stoic as a companion CLI application to Obsidian; with light configuration changes, they play perfectly together.

With the 0.6 version of Stoic, many settings align with those Obsidian defaults. In my case, only two settings are tweaked:

```shell
export STOIC_DIR="~/Obsidian/journal"
export STOIC_TEMPLATE="~/Obsidian/journal/template.md"
```

This closely corresponds to settings I have in obsidian daily notes:

The only thing that Stoic doesn't allow you to tweak is the date format. So, if you have that customized in obsidian, lousy luck.

PRs are welcome. Everything is fixable.

## Development

As a prerequisite, you need to have the [Go compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Please check the [`go.mod`](go.mod) file to see what Go version Stoic requires.

Fetch the sources:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/skatkov/stoic.git
cd stoic
```

To build the project, run:

`make build`

This automatically resolves the dependencies and compiles the source code into an executable for your platform.

## Contributions

This project is my little Go playground. It would be awesome to learn about any appropriate improvements for this codebase.

Everyone is welcome to contribute.

## TODO's

I've been brainstorming for possible improvements, and here is a rough list of ideas in no particular order:

- `stoic -cal`: perhaps with the `bubbletea` TUI framework and the `cal` utility. A calendar view for existing records showing dates marked with green dots if there is a record for that day.
- Use GoReleaser
- Improve error handling
- Use a CLI framework like [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- Add Windows support
- Add the ability to store configuration in dotfiles (not just ENV variables), including the ability to add a custom editor, not one defined in `$EDITOR`
- `stoic -stats`: statistics about journaling, % of days journaled, average journal length, etc.
